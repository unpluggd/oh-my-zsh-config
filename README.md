My personal `oh-my-zsh` config
==============================

I use a number of different Mac computers and wanted a way to 
share my terminal environment around the place. `oh-my-zsh` 
allows me to do that in a concise way with the benefits of 
`git` information directly in the terminal.

Please feel free to fork this config. If you make any further
performance tweaks I'd appreciate it if you could share it back!
